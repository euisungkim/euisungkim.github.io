## 1. Java Naming Conventions

<a name="#1.1"></a>
### 1.1: Camel case in Java Programming
* It consists of compound words or phrases such that each word or abbreviation begins with a capital letter or first word with a lowercase letter, rest all with capital.

<a name="#1.1.1"></a>
#### Classes and Interfaces:
  * <u>Class</u> names should be **nouns**, in mixed case with the **first** letter of each internal word capitalized.
  * <u>Interfaces</u> name should also be capitalized just like class names.

* Use whole words and must avoid acronyms and abbreviations.

**Examples**:

```java
Interface Bicycle
Class MountainBike implements Bicycle

Interface Sport
Class Football implements Sport
```

<a name="#1.1.2"></a>
#### Methods:
* Should be **verbs**
* **First letter lowercase**
* first letter of each internal word capitalized.

<a name="#1.1.3"></a>
#### Variables:
* Should not start with underscore(‘\_’) or dollar sign ‘$’ characters.
* Should be mnemonic *i.e*, designed to indicate to the casual observer the intent of its use.
* One-character variable names should be avoided except for temporary variables.
  * Common names for temporary variables are `i, j, k, m, and n` for integers;
  * `c, d, and e` for characters.

**Examples**:
```java
// variables for MountainBike class
int speed = 0;
int gear = 1;
```

<a name="#1.1.4"></a>
#### Constant Variables:
* Should be **all uppercase** with words separated by underscores (“\_”).
* There are various constants used in predefined classes like Float, Long, String etc.

**Examples**:
```java
static final int MIN_WIDTH = 4;

// Some  Constant variables used in predefined Float class
public static final float POSITIVE_INFINITY = 1.0f / 0.0f;
public static final float NEGATIVE_INFINITY = -1.0f / 0.0f;
public static final float NaN = 0.0f / 0.0f;

// Some  Constant variables used in predefined Double class
public static final double POS_INF = Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY;
public static final double NEG_INF= POS_INF * -1;
public static final double NaN = POS_INF - POS_INF;
```

<a name="#1.1.5"></a>
### Packages:
* The prefix of a unique package name is always written in **all-lowercase ASCII letters**.
  * should be one of the top-level domain names, like com, edu, gov, mil, net, org.
* Subsequent components of the package name vary according to an organization’s own internal naming conventions.

**Examples**:
```java
// Say you're working on the core module of the cs project for QC Incorporated (with QC.com domain)
// Your code fragment might look like this:

package com.qc.cs.core;
import com.qc.cs.util;
```

## 2. JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a virtual computer that runs inside your physical computer.

JVM(Java Virtual Machine) acts as a run-time engine to run Java applications.
  * JVM calls the **main** method present in a java code.
  * JVM is a part of JRE(Java Run Environment).
  * Run-time Engine definition:
> A number of databases are written in Java and thus run inside the Java **Runtime** Environment.
  The JRE is thus running a database **engine** to do the work.

Java applications are called **WORA** (Write Once Run Anywhere).
  * This means a programmer can develop Java code on one system and can expect it to run on any other Java enabled system without any adjustment. This is all possible because of JVM.

When we compile a `.java` file, a `.class` file(contains **byte-code**) with the same filename is generated by the `Java compiler`. This .class file goes into various steps when we run it. These steps together describe the whole JVM.

### 2.1: Class Loader Subsystem

*Class Loader Subsystem* is responsible for three activities:
  * **Loading** [Class Loader -> Method Area -> Heap Memory]
    1. Class loader reads .class file
    2. Generate corresponding binary data
    3. Save in method area
    4. After loading .class file, JVM creates an object of type Class to represent this file in the heap memory.
  * **Linking** [V.P.R]
    1. *Verification*
      * Ensures the correctness of '.class' file
    2. *Preparation*: JVM allocates memory for =
      * Class variables
      * Initializing the memory to default values
    3. *Resolution* (Optional)
      * Replace symbolic references from the type with direct references by searching into method area to locate the referenced entity.
  * **Initialization**
    1. All static variables = values defined in code & static block (if any)

#### Loading
1. Class loader reads .class file,
2. Generate the corresponding binary data,
3. Save in method area.
    * For each .class file, JVM stores following information in method area:
        * Fully qualified name of the loaded class and its immediate parent class.
        * Whether .class file is related to Class or Interface or Enum
        * Modifier, Variables and Method information etc.
4. After loading .class file, JVM creates an object of type Class to represent this file in the heap memory.
    * This object is of type Class predefined in java.lang package. This Class object can be used by the programmer for getting class level information like name of class, parent name, methods and variable information etc. To get this object reference we can use getClass() method of Object class.

```java
// A Java program to demonstrate working of a Class type
// object created by JVM to represent .class file in
// memory.
import java.lang.reflect.Field;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;

// Java code to demonstrate use of Class object
// created by JVM
public class Test
{
  // A sample class whose information is fetched above using
  // its Class object.
  class Student
  {
    private String name;
    private int roll_No;

    public String getName() { return name; }
    public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }
    public int getRoll_no() { return roll_No; }
    public void setRoll_no(int roll_no)
    {
      this.roll_No = roll_no;
    }
  }
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Student s1 = new Student();

		// Getting hold of Class object created
		// by JVM.
		Class c1 = s1.getClass();

		// Printing type of object using c1.
		System.out.println(c1.getName());

		// getting all methods in an array
		Method m[] = c1.getDeclaredMethods();
		for (Method method : m)
			System.out.println(method.getName());

		// getting all fields in an array
		Field f[] = c1.getDeclaredFields();
		for (Field field : f)
			System.out.println(field.getName());
	}
}
```

##### Output:
```
Student
getRoll_no
setRoll_no
getName
setName
name
roll_No
```

###### Note:
For every loaded .class file, only one object of Class is created.

```java
Student s2 = new Student();
// c2 will point to same object where
// c1 is pointing
Class c2 = s2.getClass();
System.out.println(c1==c2); // true
```

#### Linking
Performs:
  1. Verification
  2. Preparation
  3. (Optionally) resolution.

**1. Verification**: It ensures the correctness of `.class` file
  * *i.e.* it checks whether this file is properly formatted and generated by valid compiler or not.
  * If verification fails, we get run-time exception `java.lang.VerifyError`.

**2. Preparation**: JVM allocates memory for class variables and initializing the memory to default values.

**3. Resolution**: It is the process of replacing symbolic references from the type with direct references. It is done by searching into method area to locate the referenced entity.

#### Initialization
In this phase, all static variables are assigned with their values defined in the code and static block(if any).
  * This is executed executed from top to bottom in a class and from parent to child in class hierarchy.

In general, there are three class loaders:

**Bootstrap class loader**: Every JVM implementation must have a bootstrap class loader, capable of loading trusted classes. It loads core java API classes present in `JAVA_HOME/jre/lib` directory. This path is popularly known as bootstrap path. It is implemented in native languages like C, C++.
  * In short, the bootstrap classloader is platform-specific machine instructions that kick off the whole classloading process.
  * All classloaders, with the exception of the bootstrap classloader, are implemented as Java classes.

**Extension class loader**: It is child of bootstrap class loader.
  * It loads the classes present in the extensions directories `JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext`(Extension path)
  * Any other directory specified by the `java.ext.dirs` system property.
  * It is implemented in java by the `sun.misc.Launcher$ExtClassLoader` class.

**System/Application class loader**: It is child of extension class loader. It is responsible to load classes from `application class path`. It internally uses Environment Variable which mapped to `java.class.path`. It is also implemented in Java by the `sun.misc.Launcher$ExtClassLoader` class.

```java
// Java code to demonstrate Class Loader subsystem
public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    // String class is loaded by bootstrap loader, and
    // bootstrap loader is not Java object, hence null
    System.out.println(String.class.getClassLoader());

    // Test class is loaded by Application loader
    System.out.println(Test.class.getClassLoader());
  }
}
```

#### Output
```
// bootstrap loader is
null
sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader@73d16e93
```

#### JVM follow *Delegation-Hierarchy principle* to load classes:
- System class loader delegate load request to extension class loader,
- Extension class loader delegate request to boot-strap class loader.
- If class found in boot-strap path, class is loaded.
- Otherwise, request again transfers to extension class loader and then to system class loader.
- At last, if system class loader fails to load class, then we get run-time exception `java.lang.ClassNotFoundException`.

### 2.2: JVM Memory

**Shared Resource**: Method area, Heap area
**Unshared Resource**: Stack area

**Method area**: All class level information like class name, immediate parent class name, methods and variables information etc. are stored, including static variables.
  * There is only one method area per JVM, thus a shared resource.

**Heap area**: Information of all objects is stored in heap area.
  * There is also one Heap Area per JVM. It is also a shared resource.

**Stack area**: For every thread, JVM create one run-time stack which is stored here.
  * Every block of this stack is called activation record/stack frame which store methods calls.
  * All local variables of that method are stored in their corresponding frame.
  * After a thread terminate, it’s run-time stack will be destroyed by JVM. It is not a shared resource.

**PC Registers**: Store address of current execution instruction of a thread. Each thread has separate PC Registers.
  * Thread:

**Native method stacks**: For every thread, separate native stack is created. It stores native method information.

### 2.3: Execution Engine
Execution engine `execute` the `.class` (bytecode). It reads the byte-code line by line, use data and information present in various memory area and execute instructions. It can be classified in three parts:
* **Interpreter**: It interprets the bytecode line by line and then executes. The disadvantage here is that when one method is called multiple times, every time interpretation is required.
* **Just-In-Time Compiler(JIT)** : It is used to increase efficiency of interpreter. It compiles the entire bytecode and changes it to native code so whenever interpreter see repeated method calls, JIT provide direct native code for that part so re-interpretation is not required, thus efficiency is improved.
* **Garbage Collector**: It destroy un-referenced objects.For more on Garbage Collector, refer Garbage Collector.

### 2.4: Java Native Interface (JNI)
* JNI enables JVM to call C/C++ libraries and to be called by C/C++ libraries which may be specific to hardware.
  * It is an interface which interacts with the [Native Method Libraries](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2860642/difference-between-library-and-native-library?rq=1) and provides the native libraries(C, C++) required for the execution.

### 2.5: Native Method Libraries
* It is a collection of the Native Libraries(C, C++) which are required by the Execution Engine.
